\section{Part A - Pre Design Stage}
\subsection{Q1}
In this part, we are asked to calculate the rated torque of the motor.

\begin{equation}
    T_{rated} = \dfrac{P_{nominal}}{\omega_{nominal}} = \dfrac{400kW}{50\pi} = 2546 \; Nm
\end{equation}

\subsection{Q2}
In this part, we are going to calculate the rated frequency of the machine, and depending on the maximum frequency, we will choose a switching frequency.

\begin{equation}
    f_{m,max} = \dfrac{2250}{60} = 37.5 Hz,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f_{max} = f_{m,max} pp = 75 Hz
\end{equation}

As we increase the switching frequency, the losses will increase. So, we need to choose an adequate switching frequency. Also, to eliminate the lower harmonics we are going to choose a large switching frequency.

We choose the switching frequency as

\begin{equation}
    f_s = 3000
\end{equation}
