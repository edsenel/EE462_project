\section{Part B: Sinusoidal PWM}
\subsection{Q1}
%simulation from 90% speed to 100% speed. Plot speed vs time, 3 phase line to line voltages, 3 phase line currents, torque vs time, d-q currents, transition time

\subsection{Q2}
% when rated speed, make TL = 0, what happens, show graphs

\subsection{Q3}
%when no load, reverse the reference, if feasible? design a braking resistor, plot speed vs time,  3 phase line currents, d-q currents, dc link voltage,  

\subsection{Q4}
